# Deployment of FortiGate-VMs on the IBM Cloud with two load balancers
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy FortiGate-VMs on IBM Cloud two with load balancers

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0.9
* Terraform Provider IBM >= 1.36.0
  Needs to install the IBM Provider pluging following the link [IBM Setup](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/terraform?topic=terraform-getting-started)
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0


## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - IBM VPC with 3 subnets - public, private and hasync
   - Two FortiGate-VM instances with 3 NICs
   - One security group with inbound and outbound rules
   - One Public IP address on each of the instances's port1
   - One public Gateways for public subnets in the VPC.
   - Two FortiGate-VM instances which will be preconfigured with the necessary ip configurations and autos-scale settings..
   - One External load balancer, and one internal load balancer.
   - One route table associated with private subnet with egress route to the private ip of internal load balancer

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM HA (a-p) on the IBM cloud:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
Outputs:

FGTLBPublicIP = "<LB Public IP>"
Password = "<FGT Password>"
Username = "admin"
fgt2publicip = "<FGT1 Public IP>"
fgtpublicip = "<FGT2 Public IP>"

```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
