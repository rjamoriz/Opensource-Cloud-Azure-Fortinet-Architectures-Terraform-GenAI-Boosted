# Deployment of a FortiGate-VM on the Openstack
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy FortiGate-VM on Openstack

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 0.14.0
* Terraform Provider Openstack >= 1.35.0
* FortiGate-VM Flex VM token license

## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - FortiGate-VM instance(s) with two NICS

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to Openstack:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
Outputs: 
                 
Default_Password = <default password> 
Default_Username = admin 
IP_Address = {                                  
  "<instance name>" = "<instance ipv4 address>"                    
  :  
}     

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
