# Deployment of a FortiGate-VM(BYOL/PAYG) HA cluster on the Alicloud
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy a FortiGate-VM(BYOL/PAYG) HA cluster on Alicloud in same zone

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0.9
* Terraform Provider Alicloud >= 1.162.0
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0
* Terraform Provider Random >= 3.1.2


## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - Alicloud Virtual Network with 3 subnets in same zone
   - Two FortiGate-VM instances with 3 NICs in a-p HA mode.
   - One custom route table, with one default route to FortiGate.

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to Alicloud:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
ActiveMgmtPIP = "XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"
ClusterPublicIP = "XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"
PassiveMgmtPIP = "XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"
Password = <FGT Password>
Username = "admin"
```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
