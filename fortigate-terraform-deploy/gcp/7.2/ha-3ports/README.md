# Deployment of FortiGate-VM HA on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with 3 ports in single zone
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy FortiGate-VM HA (A-P) on GCP with 3 ports in single zone

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0.9
* Terraform Provider for Google Cloud Platform 3.90.0
* Terraform Provider for Google Cloud Platform Beta 3.90.0
* Terraform Provider for random 3.1.0
* A [GCP OAuth2 access token](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)

## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with one public subnet
   - A VPC with two private subnets
   - Two FortiGate-VM instances with three NICs
   - Three firewall rules: one for external, one for internal, one for sync/HA management.
   - One internal route associate to the private subnet
   - One forwarding rule with two different target groups.  Each target group points to the FortiGates.
   - During the HA failover, cluster ip, internal route, and forwarding rule will fail from the active unit to the passive unit.

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to GCP:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Obtain a GCP OAuth2 token and input it in the vars.tf file.
3. Customize variables in the `vars.tf` file as needed.
4. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
5. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
6. Verify output.
7. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
8. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
FortiGate-HA-Active-MGMT-IP = XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
FortiGate-HA-Cluster-IP = XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
FortiGate-HA-Passive-MGMT-IP = XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
FortiGate-Password = <password here>
FortiGate-Username = admin
Fowarding-IP-Address = "XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"
```
*After deployment, user can add extra forwarding rule if needs to have extra public ip forwarding traffic to FortiGate-VM instances. User would need to configure the VIP to use with the forwarding rule.*


## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
