## 🔧 Configuration Examples

### Basic GCP Deployment
```python
# Example configuration for single FortiGate on GCP
config = {
    "project_id": "my-project",
    "region": "us-central1",
    "zone": "us-central1-a",
    "machine_type": "e2-standard-4",
    "deployment_name": "fortigate-production"
}
```

### Multi-Cloud HA Setup
```python
# High availability across Azure and GCP
azure_config = {
    "location": "East US",
    "vm_size": "Standard_D4s_v3",
    "availability_zone": "1"
}

gcp_config = {
    "region": "us-east1",
    "zone": "us-east1-b",
    "machine_type": "e2-standard-4"
}
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Authentication Errors
```bash
# Re-authenticate with Google Cloud
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login

# Verify authentication
gcloud auth list
```

#### 2. Permission Issues
```bash
# Set up service account with proper roles
~/.fortigate-chatbot/gcp/setup_service_account.sh

# Verify IAM roles
gcloud projects get-iam-policy $GCP_PROJECT_ID
```

#### 3. Terraform State Issues
```bash
# Set up Terraform backend
~/.fortigate-chatbot/gcp/setup_terraform_backend.sh

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init
```

#### 4. Network Connectivity
- Check VPC configuration
- Verify firewall rules
- Validate subnet CIDR ranges
- Confirm routing tables

### Getting Help

1. **Check logs**: Look for error messages in the Streamlit app
2. **Validate configuration**: Use the built-in validation tools
3. **Test connectivity**: Use the network diagnostic features
4. **Review documentation**: Check Google Cloud and FortiGate docs
