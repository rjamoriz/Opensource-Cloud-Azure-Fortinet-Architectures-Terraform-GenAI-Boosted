## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Azure Service Principal with appropriate permissions
- Google Cloud Service Account with required roles
- FortiGate licenses and API access
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements_cloud_mcp.txt
```

### Configuration
1. Set up cloud credentials in `.env` file
2. Configure FortiGate API endpoints
3. Initialize MCP server connection
4. Verify cloud connectivity

## API Endpoints

### Azure Operations
- `/azure/resources` - List all Azure resources
- `/azure/fortigates` - Get FortiGate VM status
- `/azure/deploy` - Deploy new FortiGate instance
- `/azure/security` - Security assessment

### Google Cloud Operations
- `/gcp/resources` - List GCP resources
- `/gcp/fortigates` - Get FortiGate instance status
- `/gcp/deploy` - Deploy FortiGate on GCP
- `/gcp/security` - Security posture analysis

### Multi-Cloud Operations
- `/multicloud/dashboard` - Unified cloud dashboard
- `/multicloud/costs` - Cross-cloud cost analysis
- `/multicloud/security` - Global security overview
- `/multicloud/compliance` - Compliance status

## Security Considerations
- All credentials encrypted at rest
- TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging for all operations
- Zero-trust network architecture
